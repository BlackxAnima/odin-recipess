    <h3>Curry Chicken: A fragrant and comforting dish featuring tender chicken simmered in a blend of aromatic spices and creamy coconut milk. Each bite delivers a perfect balance of warmth and depth, making it a favorite for cozy dinners or casual gatherings.</h3>
    <p>
        This curry chicken recipe is a celebration of bold flavors and comforting aromas. To start, tender pieces of chicken are marinated in a blend of yogurt, turmeric, and garam masala, ensuring each bite is infused with a rich depth of spices. The marinated chicken is then gently simmered in a fragrant sauce made from onions, garlic, ginger, tomatoes, and a medley of spices including cumin, coriander, and chili powder. Coconut milk is added to create a creamy texture that perfectly balances the robust flavors of the curry.

            In a bowl, combine the plain yogurt, turmeric powder, garam masala, salt, and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the bite-sized chicken pieces to the marinade, ensuring they are evenly coated.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat vegetable oil or ghee in a large skillet or Dutch oven over medium heat.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the finely chopped onion and saut√© until softened and translucent, about 5-7 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Sprinkle in the cumin powder, coriander powder, and chili powder, stirring well to combine with the onion-tomato mixture. Cook for another 1-2 minutes to toast the spices.
