    <h3>Garlic Steak: Juicy, flavorful cuts infused with robust garlic, seared to perfection for a mouthwatering experience.</h3>
    <p>This garlic steak recipe combines the bold flavors of garlic with succulent
         steak, creating a dish that's both simple and satisfying.
          To prepare, start by marinating your choice of steak with minced garlic
