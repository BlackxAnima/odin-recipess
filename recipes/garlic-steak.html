    <h3>Garlic Steak: Juicy, flavorful cuts infused with robust garlic, seared to perfection for a mouthwatering experience.</h3>
    <p>This garlic steak recipe combines the bold flavors of garlic with succulent
         steak, creating a dish that's both simple and satisfying.
          To prepare, start by marinating your choice of steak with minced garlic
          , olive oil, salt, and pepper. Allow the steak to absorb the flavors for at
           least 30 minutes, ensuring each bite is infused with garlic goodness.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lbs (about 900g) of steak (such as ribeye, sirloin, or New York strip)
        </li>
        <li>4 cloves of garlic, minced
        </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil
        </li>
        <li>Salt and pepper, to taste
        </li>
        <li>Optional: Fresh herbs like thyme or rosemary for garnish
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            In a bowl, combine minced garlic, olive oil, salt, and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place the steak in a shallow dish or resealable plastic bag and pour the marinade over it, ensuring the steak is evenly coated.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cover or seal the dish/bag and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat your grill or a skillet over medium-high heat. If using a skillet, add a bit of olive oil to coat the surface.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove the steak from the marinade, allowing any excess marinade to drip off.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place the steak on the grill or skillet. Cook the steak for about 4-5 minutes per side for medium-rare, adjusting the time according to your preferred level of doneness.
        </li>
        <li>
            For grill marks, rotate the steak 90 degrees halfway through cooking on each side.

        </li>
        <li>Once cooked to your liking, remove the steak from the grill or skillet and let it rest on a cutting board for a few minutes. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the meat.
        </li>
        <li>Slice the steak against the grain into thin strips.
        </li>
        <li><em> Optionally</em>,garnish with fresh herbs like thyme or rosemary.
        </li>
    </ol>
